# Kernel Methods challenge
Challenge in the Kernel Methods course at MVA - 2020-2021 hosted by Kaggle.

In this repository we present our implementation of several kernels, either working on bags of words or on raw string data.

We have implemented the following models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Kernel Ridge Regression
  - Kernel Support Vector Machines
  - Multiple Kernel Learning
 
 We have dealt with the following kernels:
  - Gaussian kernel on bags of words
  - Spectrum kernel on raw sequences
  - Mismatch kernel on raw sequences
  - Substring kernel on raw sequences
  - Fisher kernel on raw sequences
  - Sum of kernels
